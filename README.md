# Soccer Event Detection - Information Retrieval Project - Paolo Cortis

Definition of a ML approach for event detection on still images.
Experiments with Convolutional Neural Networks, clustering models, data augmentation and transfer learning on still images with the Soccer EVent (SEV) dataset.

The project focuses on the definition of a pipeline to tackle the task, the construction of the models and the design of sound experimental procedures to obtain statistically reliable results.
