# Soccer Event Detection - Information Retrieval Project - Paolo Cortis

Definition of a ML approach for event detection on still images.
Experiments with Convolutional Neural Networks, clustering models, data augmentation and transfer learning on still images with the Soccer EVent (SEV) dataset.

The project focuses on designing a pipeline to tackle the task, construct the models and design sound experimental procedures to obtain statistically reliable results.
